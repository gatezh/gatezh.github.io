The initial idea was to write a small post about how to create a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub. However, when I started to dig dipper and had realized how many things I'll have to describe to make it a manual I've decided to make this index page which will collect all the posts about this topic. I will try to keep it up to date and make changes whenever I figure out more.
